### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I just graduated from Prime Digital Academy, an intensive, full-time, five-month software development program in Minneapolis, MN.
- 💬 Ask me about my solo project Bookworm and my group client project for OQX. Both are pinned below as they become available.
- :pencil2: Take a look at the readme files for both projects to see their documentation and learn how you can see them in action.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://taylorcmoe.carrd.co/
